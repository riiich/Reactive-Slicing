# Reactive-Slicing

Reactive Slicing is a VR game!
The purpose of this game is very simple.
This game tests the players' reaction skills by slicing objects.
There are three areas that the player is able to interact with, two of which will test the players' reaction and one area allows the player to freely have fun and slice objects that randomly spawn in-place.

Objective:
 - Test player reaction. 
 - First Area:
    - Player slices objects that are flying directly at them.
 - Second Area:
    - Player slices objects that fly up and falls down.
 - There is a scoreboard that is statically located at the top left, which the player can reference to keep track of their progress.
 - The player starts off at 0 points.
 - There will be objects that allow the user to gain points, lose points, and reset their point back to 0.
 - If their score goes below 0, they lose the game.
